Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue

Firefox detected a potential security threat and did not continue to forum.level1techs.com because this website requires a secure connection.

What can you do about it?

forum.level1techs.com has a security policy called HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which means that Firefox can only connect to it securely. You can’t add an exception to visit this site.

The issue is most likely with the website, and there is nothing you can do to resolve it.

If you are on a corporate network or using anti-virus software, you can reach out to the support teams for assistance. You can also notify the website’s administrator about the problem.

Sorry. We just need to do one small thing to keep going.

Firefox has just been updated in the background. Click Restart Firefox to complete the update.

We will restore all your pages, windows and tabs afterwards, so you can be on your way quickly.
